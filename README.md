# 220LuaThings
Some Lua, C++, and text files demonstrating some cool things about Lua.

Place all of these into an IDE of your choice that can run both Lua and C++ (I used VSCode). For the C++ files, follow the header instructions for the specific way to compile them (adding a `-llua` after the file name). For Lua code, just use `lua file_name.lua`.
